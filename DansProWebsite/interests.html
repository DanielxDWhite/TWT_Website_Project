<h3>Here is a list of my interests, in a rough decending order.</h3>
<H5> <u> Cold Atoms</u> </H5>
<p>Cold atoms are the playground of quantum mechanics, and the quantum world is a place where classically forbidden things happen.</p>
<li>Sensors</li>
<p>Quantum systems are incredibly sensitive to external perturbations. This makes them a challenge to create, control and maintain coherence. An enemble of cold atoms, when shone upon by some clever sequence of light pulses, can reveal information about the enviornment, including precision measurments of gravity, the rate of change of it (a mind-boggelingly tiny quantity), <em>and much more.</em> </p>
<li>Clocks</li>
<p>The Einstein-Planck relation which states that the energy of a photon is proportional to its frequency. This, combined with the fact that we humans are better at measuring frequnecies than <strong>any</strong> other quantity lets us know that a quantum system is a great place to build a clock upon.</p>
<br>
<h5><u>Artifical Neural Networks</u></h5>
<p> I am interested in learning more about NNs, their real world implementation, limitations and training.</p>
<br>
<h5><u>Radar Technology</u></h5>
<p>Radar as was first used to dertect distant objects as far back as 1904. Two world wars and over 100 years later we find ourselves with radar as one of the most mature technologies of them all. We can, amongst many other things, detect human(-ish) sized objects as far as 5 miles away, and measure the doppler shifts induced by moving targets to get precise information of the velocity (and of course position) of it in all 3 spatial dimensions.</p>
<h6>I am soon to embark on a PhD in which all 3 of these technologies will be conbined in the hope to prevent nutters from successfully flying drones into airplanes taking off</h6>
